\title{DEM/GBP exchange rate log-returns}
\description{%
  The vector \code{dem2gbp} contains daily observations of the
  Deutschmark vs British Pound foreign exchange rate log-returns. This data
  set has been promoted as an informal benchmark for GARCH time-series software validation. See
  McCullough and Renfro (1999), and Brooks, Burke, and Persand (2001) for details. The nominal returns are
  expressed in percent as in Bollerslev and Ghysels (1996). The sample period is from 
  January 3, 1984, to December 31, 1991, for a total of 1974 observations.
