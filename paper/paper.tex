\section*{Summary}

The package bayesGARCH implements in R \citep{R} the Bayesian estimation procedure described
in Ardia (2008, chapter 5) for the GARCH(1,1) model with  Student-t
innovations. The  approach consists  of  a
Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm where the proposal  distributions  are  constructed  from  auxiliary
ARMA processes on the squared observations.  This methodology avoids the time-consuming and difficult task, 
especially for non-experts, of choosing and tuning a sampling algorithm. We refer the user to \citet{Ardia2008} and \citet{ArdiaHoogerheide2010} for illustrations.
The latest version of the package is available at \url{https://github.com/ArdiaD/bayesGARCH}.
